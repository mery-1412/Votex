# VoteX: Decentralized Voting Application

**VoteX** is a hybrid blockchain-based voting application that combines the security and transparency of blockchain with the efficiency of traditional web apps. The goal is to create a secure, transparent, and accessible digital voting ecosystem suitable for academic, organizational, or community elections.

##  Overview

VoteX addresses the core challenges in modern digital voting systems:

- **Security**: Voting logic is executed on the Energy Web Volta blockchain.
- **Transparency**: All votes are permanently and publicly verifiable on-chain.
- **Accessibility**: Simple and intuitive user interface for non-technical users.
- **Scalability**: Hybrid architecture supports elections of varying sizes.

##  Smart Contract Deployment

### Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts (Hardhat)

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network volta
```

After deployment, update the `constants.js` file in the frontend with the contract address.

---

##  Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` folder:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

##  Frontend Setup

Go back to the root directory:

```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

Visit the app at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

##  Development & Contribution

### Local Smart Contract Testing

```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### deploying Smart Contract in Volta testnet

Run the command:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network volta

Next add the address of the deployed contract (printed as a result of the previous command) in the "context/constants.js" file.
